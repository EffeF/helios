# Default provider
By default, Helios doesn't come with any provider installed, but you can install the default one by adding this URL: https://pastebin.com/raw/9U5MMr1J  
This is the provider for [Legit Torrents](http://www.legittorrents.info) (100% Legally Free Media).


# Create your own provider
If you'd like to know how providers work and create your own, read the [wiki](https://github.com/wako-unofficial-addons/helios/wiki/Providers)
