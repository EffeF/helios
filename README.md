# What is Helios?
Helios is a third-party add-on for [wako](https://wako.app), it is not developed nor endorsed by wako.  
Helios is a source finder that scrapes third-party sites (called providers) that are **publicly available** on the internet. It's like a search engine.  
Helios does not host, upload or manage any of the content on these sites and Helios's add-on, staff and/or developers have no control over the content on these third party sites.   
Helios claims no responsibility for copyright, legality, accuracy, compliance, decency or any other aspect of the content displayed.   
It is positively the responsibility of the end user to avoid any actions that may constitute a violation of national, federal or terrestrial laws applicable to them.  

# Default provider
By default, Helios doesn't come with any provider installed, but you can install the default one by adding this URL: https://pastebin.com/raw/9U5MMr1J  
This is the provider for [Legit Torrents](http://www.legittorrents.info) (100% Legally Free Media).


# Create your own provider
If you'd like to know how providers work and create your own, read the [wiki](https://github.com/wako-unofficial-addons/helios/wiki/Providers)
